### Key Features

1. Stock Data Exploration
   Users can compare multiple fast-food companies from a preloaded list, making trend analysis straightforward.

2. Stock Price Visualization

The app features candlestick charts with a red-green color scheme for intuitive tracking of stock movements. A moving average line smooths fluctuations and highlights trends, while the responsive design ensures a seamless experience across all devices.

3. Trading Volume Analysis

A gradient-style bar chart visually represents trading volume trends at a glance. Hovering over individual bars reveals detailed trading activity, making it easy to identify periods of high and low volume.

4. Market Summary Dashboard

This dashboard offers a quick snapshot of key financial metrics, including the latest closing price, highest and lowest stock values within the selected range, and total trading volume. Users can instantly gain insights without sifting through raw data.

5. Interactive Controls

Users can customize their analysis with a range of intuitive tools: a dropdown for company selection, a date picker to refine the timeframe, a toggle to switch between adjusted and raw closing prices, and a slider for moving average adjustments. A search bar allows quick lookups, and a file uploader enables the addition of new stock data.
